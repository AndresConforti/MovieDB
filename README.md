# TheMovieDB App Part Two

## TASK: Create an App to display a Movie list with details page.

### STEPS:
 
- A Movies list app using mocked data from a JSON. The original data was fetched from the [TheMovieDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) and modified for simplicity: This exercise was made to explain:
  - [Scrollable widgets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WDI13a02YHJ65opd5Fsdgx61lyhfHHSU?usp=drive_link) (SingleChildScrollView and ListView)
  - Common-use widgets
  - [Navigation between Pages](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10San6cz5vUtfmyjH7Ywo7OctRIs93hhK?usp=drive_link)
  - Data Modeling and JSON parsing

- The main objective of this exercise is to introduce JSON consumption. The students will modify their current project, a movies list application that fetches its data from a mocked local source, parsing and modeling the data.

- You will use the [previous movie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwhzSIIW8qr0C01PmJQGrxAUqIVOFKO-/edit) card and add the new information that the json has, to complement the card.

### Local source

- Here is the json with the movies that you will use:
  - [Movies Mock Data](https://test.com)
  - [Genres Mock Data](https://test.com)
